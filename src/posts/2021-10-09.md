# Portfolio website

Well I finally bit the bullet and build a little blogging website.

## Design

Like all good non-designer devs I took to Dribbble for inspiration on layouts and themes - the pantheon of slick reels, animations and bespoke, beautiful designs was awe-inspiring.

There's no way in hell I could build any of them in half a weekend.

Thankfully, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) would allow me to throw something together relatively painlessly

## Choosing a framework

Having mainly worked in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) before, I wanted to see what all this [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (specifically [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)) fuss was about!
